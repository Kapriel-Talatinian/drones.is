# Roadmap

- Establish telemetry logging and replay for simulated flights.
- Integrate vision model for terrain scoring and obstacle detection.
- Add safety envelope with return-to-launch behavior.
- Prototype seed deployment mechanism with adjustable spacing.
- Validate missions in simulation before hardware flights.
